If you find yourself reading code without a GUI, this .vimrc will help. It turns on a few features to do with search and code folding. If you've never used Vim before, here's the basic list of commands useful when reading (not editing) code:

Basic movement:
hjkl, Ctrl-d, Ctrl-u, Ctrl-f, Ctrl-b

Code navigation:
gd, gD - find symbol definitions
navigation in blocks with %, [{, [(, [/ etc

gf - open file under cursor
:e filename - open file

Windows:
Ctrl-w s (and Ctrl-w everything else)
My Vimrc maps Shift-up and Shift-down to navigate between windows

Searches:
with / ? n #
:vimgrep /pattern/[j][g] file file2... fileN

Code folding:
zA (and the whole set: zc, zC, zo, zO, zM, zR)

Undo:
u or Shift-u. Or use 'view' instead of 'vi' in shell
